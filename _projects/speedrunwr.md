I've always enjoyed video games, and particularly enjoy watching video game speedrunning 
events such as [Games Done Quick](https://gamesdonequick.com/). 
At around the same time I had been messing around with laravel and Vue.js I found out 
that [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/) had an api. I thought it would be neat to make a tool to find random speedrun world records to watch. 
Other people ended up liking the idea as well and it was featured on 
[Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/website-finds-you-a-great-speedrun-with-the-push-of-a-b-1796341109), 
[Destructoid](https://www.destructoid.com/watch-a-random-world-record-speedrun-all-day-every-day-444580.phtml), 
[Gameinformer](https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2017/06/22/move-over-netflix-watch-this-endless-stream-of-speedrun-videos-instead.aspx), and
