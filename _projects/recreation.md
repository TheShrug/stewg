My wife and I love going camping and were bummed that all the campsites at Joshua Tree National Park were booked through to the summer. 

By the end of that evening I had a bot up and running that would notify me in a Slack channel when someone cancelled a reservation. By noon the next day we had a campsite reserved at our first pick campground on our preferred date.

We've gone multiple more times since.
