A couple friends and I decided to participate in a [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) 72hr game jam in 2017. The theme was 'A Small World'.

For our first and only game, I'm still very proud of what we were able to accomplish in such a short time. My primary contributions were programming and sound design.
