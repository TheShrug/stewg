European Speedrunner Assembly is another video game speedrunning event that mostly consists of European participants.
The recorded videos from the event are hosted on various platforms and I wanted to create a website that could serve as
an index for all of the videos. 

The project features a custom Vue.js CMS (that most wont ever see!) as a backend to manage all of the data.
